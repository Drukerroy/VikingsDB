In the early 90s, Andre developed a unique way to communicate with animals through sound and motion performance. He traveled with the Uzbek theatre company ""Ichki Olov"" for four years in the Amazon jungle where they lived off the earth and performed the play ""AhkAh HA babaklah"" for a large group of black spider monkeys and a giant river otter. Video recordings of these plays now serve as the backbone of interspecies communication studies around the world. The theatre company dissolved in '94, and Andre isolated himself in the Himalayas for years. Here he practiced Buddhism and wrote the masterpiece ""Reflections of a wounded teardrop"" The mysterious short film was never publicly released, and its contents remains unseen. Eriksen stars and directs himself in the film that features none other than the Dalai Lama himself as the evil antagonist ""Hon Eps Egel"" who is trying to lure Eriksen's character to buy an overpriced 1991 Toyota Corolla and steals his sleeping bag during a 24-hour trip to Copenhagen.As an activist Andre ran with the bulls in Pamplona. The bulls took him in as one of their own and during the event Andre rammed and injured several participants in the name of his herd.""Accipit ingenium ad cognoscendum ingenium."" The quote was forged by pope John Paul the second and translates: It takes a genius to know a genius. The expression came to life when the Vatican was looking for someone to restore Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel, a task deemed impossible. Eriksen was commissioned and chose to use crayons for the task. ""You must understand the chemical complexity of your tools"", said Eriksen while applying his advanced technique of rubbing any substance between his thumb and long finger while squinting with a distant stare. The technique proved itself to be accurate and the result of the restoration is considered perfect and expected to last forever.Early Days
As a child Andre was raised deep in the jungle by wolves with the assistance of a clumsy bear and an empathetic panther. When a mean tiger gets it in for him, they all decide it's time for Andre to find his way back to the humans. In the 80s, Andre was a drifter and made his way to the outskirts of a small town called Hope, Washington. Here he was arrested by a sadistic Police officer, subjecting him to the same kind of torture he suffered as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Andre escapes to the woods on a motorcycle. He loses control and his violent rage triggers a huge deadly manhunt. During this incident Andre had long hair and he would wear a red band around his forehead to keep hair out of his face.

colleague Sven Nordin. Through the 1980s Nordin drifted into success in
television while Ellefsen remained a respected stage actor, well known
to the theater-going public, but far from a household name.Ellefsen proved himself to be a cheerful comic actor in comedies and
musicals, turning in some memorable performances in children and family
plays such as the title role in Oslo Nye Teater's 1988 version of
""Karlsson på taket"", based on Astrid Lindgren's popular childrens book.
His portrayal of Karlsson was hysterically funny sending kids and
adults alike screaming with laughter.Despite rave reviews on stage, some supporting roles in TV and films,
it wasn't until 1999's Absolutt blåmandag (1999) he made a mark for himself on the big
screen, with a scene-stealing supporting role as an accident-prone
hairdresser in one of that years most popular Norwegian movies.In 2000 success on the small screen followed, as the retarted 'Trosten'
in the popular drama-series Soria Moria (2000). Then, to finally seal his fate as
one of Norway's best loved actors, the same year he co-starred with his
old friend Sven Nordin on stage in ""Brødre i blodet"" (Brothers in
Blood), playing the mentally handicapped Elling opposite Nordin's
somewhat dim-witted oaf Kjell Bjarne. The show was based on a
successful series of books by Ingvar Ambjørnsen, and the huge stage
success made the public cry out for a Elling/Kjell-Bjarne-movie.The movie-version, titled Elling (2001), premiered in 2001 with Ellefsen and
Nordin re-creating their roles for the big screen. ""Elling"" quickly
turned into a wide-spread phenomenon! Seen by 800,000 Norwegian
moviegoers (in a country with just 4.2 million people) it also became
the most successful Norwegian film in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark
ever!As if this wasn't enough, the charming audience-pleaser ""Elling"" in
2002 received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language
Film, sending Ellefsen, co-star Sven Nordin, director Petter Næss and
producer Dag Alveberg on a (in Norway) highly publicized trip to
Hollywood celebrating the movies success. Per Christian Ellefsen had
